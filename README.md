Field validation utility for Java

## What is it?
First off, it isn't a replacement for bean validation, it is meant to be used along with it.
It's main purpose is to help with regular expressions on POJO's, so that you, the developer, can have cleaner code.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/staggeredbard/stagflation/wiki) for some usage examples
